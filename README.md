# Solar System Model

Hobby model of our solar system with accuracy of 1 degree. The values and math
in the project are based off this [ResearchGate publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45878423_Determining_planetary_positions_in_the_sky_for_50_years_to_an_accuracy_of_1_degree_with_a_calculator).

## Calculation Method

TODO: Elaborate on math

This project was started as an attempt to get a basic understanding of how this
sort of math works. I am no expert in any of this, and the calculations in the
code base could very well be dead wrong.

## Goals

The idea is to build this out into a canvas model of the solar system, with an
input field with the ability to change date.
