# Solar System

A console application written in rust to print a planet's location in degrees.
Assuming this application's calculations are correct, the planets positions
have an accuracy of 1 degree for about 50 years from the reference date (`solar_system::planet::Planet::ref_date`).
The math in this project are based off this [ResearchGate publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45878423_Determining_planetary_positions_in_the_sky_for_50_years_to_an_accuracy_of_1_degree_with_a_calculator).
